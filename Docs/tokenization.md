# Text PreProcessing

## Tokenization

There are two types of tokenization
Sentence Level tokenization
Word level tokenization (Mosty useds)

## Stemming 
Stemming -> This reduces the word to their root form 

Let's consider the words -> Dancing,Danced,Dancer,Dances 

This all gets converted to Dance

This is less used 

Before stemming we must tokenize the raw text data
